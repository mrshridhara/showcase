A repository to showcase best possible implementation of a business application using suitable design patterns.

These applications are written entirely using the Express editions of Visual studio hence you will find two solutions for each version respectively.

Thanks to:
* Microsoft for providing the Express editions of Visual Studo. Also for .NET Framework.
* StructureMap for providing an awesome IoC framework.
